# Perhaps

A highly experimental (and not-yet-even-remotely-developed) golfing language. The name refers both to the backtracking (emulated by the list monad in all its lazy glory), and to the uncertainty as to whether or not the syntax is going to make a lick of sense.

Run with `stack run -- [flags] 'program' [arguments]` (`-v`/`--verbose` flag is mandatory until SBCS syntax is implemented)
